        <p>
          Python is an interpreted high-level general-purpose programming
          language. Its design philosophy emphasizes code readability with its
          use of significant indentation. Its language constructs as well as its
          object-oriented approach aim to help programmers write clear, logical
          code for small and large-scale projects.
        </p>

        <h4>Varibles</h4>
        <p>
          Variables are nothing but reserved memory locations to store values.
          This means that when you create a variable you reserve some space in
          memory.
        </p>
        <code>
          <p>counter = 100 # An integer assignment</p>
          <p>miles = 1000.0 # A floating point</p>
          <p>name = "John" # A string</p>
          <p>print counter <br />print miles <br />print name</p>
        </code>
        <h5>Multiple Assignment</h5>
        <code>
          <p>a = b = c = 1</p>
        </code>
        <h4>Datatypes</h4>
        <p>
          The data stored in memory can be of many types. For example, a
          person's age is stored as a numeric value and his or her address is
          stored as alphanumeric characters. Python has various standard data
          types that are used to define the operations possible on them and the
          storage method for each of them.
        </p>
        <p>Python has five standard data types −</p>
        <ol>
          <strong>Number</strong>
        </ol>
        <p>Example</p>
        <code>
          <p>#This is simple representation of numbers in python</p>
          <p>var1=10</p>
          <p>var2=19</p>
        </code>
        <ol>
          <strong>String</strong>

        <code>
          <p>#These are ways you can create strings.<br /></p>
          <p>var1="This is a string"</p>
          <p>var2='This is also a string'</p>
        </code>
        <ol>
          <strong>List</strong>
        </ol>
        <p>Example</p>
        <code>
          <p>#This is how you can create list</p>
          <p>var1=[] #this is an empty list</p>
          <p>var2=[1,3,5,6]</p>
          <p>var3=['hello',"hi",'why']</p>
        </code>
        <ol>
          <strong>Tuple</strong>
        </ol>
        <p>Example</p>
        <code>
          <p>#This is how you can create tuple</p>
          <p>var1=() #empty tuple</p>
          <p>var2=(4,) #tuple with single value in it</p>
          <p>var3=("hello",5,6)</p>

          A function is a block of code which only runs when it is called. You
          can pass data, known as parameters, into a function. A function can
          return data as a result.
        </p>
        <code>
          <p>#This is how you create a function</p>
          <p>
            def add(attribute1,attribute2) #a function can take number of
            attribute which can be used in block of code
          </p>
          <p>#This is how you call a function</p>
          <p>
            Add(att1,att2) #if you have defined a function with attribute the
            you have to pass it while calling

        <p>
          Python is an object oriented programming language. Almost everything
          in Python is an object, with its properties and methods. A Class is
          like an object constructor, or a "blueprint" for creating objects.
        </p>
        <code>
          <p>#This is how you create a class</p>
          <p>class Number:</p>
        </code>
        <p>To use class you have to create objects</p>
        <code>
          <p>#This is how you create objects of class</p>
          <p>obj.Number()</p>

          <h2>Python modules</h2>
        </header>
        <p>
          If you quit from the Python interpreter and enter it again, the
          definitions you have made (functions and variables) are lost.
          Therefore, if you want to write a somewhat longer program, you are
          better off using a text editor to prepare the input for the
          interpreter and running it with that file as input instead. This is
          known as creating a script. As your program gets longer, you may want
          to split it into several files for easier maintenance. You may also
          want to use a handy function that you’ve written in several programs
          without copying its definition into each program. To support this,
          Python has a way to put definitions in a file and use them in a script
          or in an interactive instance of the interpreter. Such a file is
          called a module; definitions from a module can be imported into other
          modules or into the main module (the collection of variables that you
          have access to in a script executed at the top level and in calculator
          mode). A module is a file containing Python definitions and
          statements. The file name is the module name with the suffix .py
          appended. Within a module, the module’s name (as a string) is
          available as the value of the global variable __name__. For instance,
          use your favorite text editor to create a file called fibo.py in the
          current directory with the following contents:
        </p>
        <code>
          <p>#This is how you import modules</p>
          <p>import modulename</p>
        </code>
