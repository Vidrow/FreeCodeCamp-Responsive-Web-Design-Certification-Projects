    <p>
      Python is an interpreted high-level general-purpose programming language.

    <ul>
      <li>AI and machine learning</li>
      <p>
        Because Python is such a stable, flexible, and simple programming
        language, it’s perfect for various machine learning (ML) and artificial
        intelligence (AI) projects. In fact, Python is among the favourite
        languages among data scientists, and there are many Python machine
        learning and AI libraries and packages available.
      </p>
      <li>Data analytics</li>
      <p>
        Much like AI and machine learning, data analytics is another rapidly
        developing field that utilises Python programming. At a time when we’re
        creating more data than ever before, there is a need for those who can
        collect, manipulate and organise the information. Python for data
        science and analytics makes sense. The language is easy-to-learn,
        flexible, and well-supported, meaning it’s relatively quick and easy to
        use for analysing data. When working with large amounts of information,
        it’s useful for manipulating data and carrying out repetitive tasks.
      </p>
      <li>Data Visualization</li>
      <p>
        Data visualisation is another popular and developing area of interest.
        Again, it plays into many of the strengths of Python. As well as its
        flexibility and the fact it’s open-source, Python provides a variety of
        graphing libraries with all kinds of features. Whether you’re looking to
        create a simple graphical representation or a more interactive plot, you
        can find a library to match your needs. Examples include Pandas
        Visualization and Plotly. The possibilities are vast, allowing you to
        transform data into meaningful insights. If data visualisation with
        Python sounds appealing, check out our 12-week ExpertTrack on the
        subject. You’ll learn how to leverage Python libraries to interpret and
        analyse data sets.
      </p>
      <li>Web Development</li>
      <p>
        Python is a great choice for web development. This is largely due to the
        fact that there are many Python web development frameworks to choose
        from, such as Django, Pyramid, and Flask. These frameworks have been
        used to create sites and services such as Spotify, Reddit and Mozilla.
        Thanks to the extensive libraries and modules that come with Python
        frameworks, functions such as database access, content management, and
        data authorisation are all possible and easily accessible. Given its
        versatility, it’s hardly surprising that Python is so widely used in web
        development.
      </p>
      <li>Finance</li>
      <p>
        Python is increasingly being utilised in the world of finance, often in
        areas such as quantitative and qualitative analysis. It can be a
        valuable tool in determining asset price trends and predictions, as well
        as in automating workflows across different data sources. As mentioned
        already, Python is an ideal tool for working with big data sets, and
        there are many libraries available to help with compiling and processing
        information. As such, it’s one of the preferred languages in the finance
        industry.
      </p>
      <li>Search Engine Optimization</li>
      <p>
        Another slightly surprising entry on our list of Python uses is in the
        field of search engine optimisation (SEO). It’s an area that often
        benefits from automation, which is certainly possible through Python.
        Whether it’s implementing changes across multiple pages or categorising
        keywords, Python can help. Emerging technologies such as natural
        language processing (NLP) are also likely to be relevant to those
        working in SEO. Python can be a powerful tool in developing these NLP
        skills and understanding how people search and how search engines return
        results.
      </p>
      <li>Game Development</li>
      <p>
        Although far from an industry-standard in game development, Python does
        have its uses in the industry. It’s possible to create simple games
        using the programming language, which means it can be a useful tool for
        quickly developing a prototype. Similarly, certain functions (such as
        dialogue tree creation) are possible in Python. If you’re new to either
        Python or game development, then you can also discover how to make a
        text-based game in Python. In doing so, you can work on a variety of
        skills and improve your knowledge in various areas.
